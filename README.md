# Employee-Salary-Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education level, job title, and more.

## 📘 Overview

Accurately predicting salaries can help HR departments, job seekers, and businesses make informed decisions. This notebook demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `EmployeeSalaryPredic.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the end-to-end workflow.
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: (Optional) Folder to save trained models or results.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Visualizations and insights from EDA
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Performance

The notebook evaluates models using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-prediction.git
   cd employee-salary-prediction
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook:


jupyter notebook EmployeeSalaryPredic.ipynb
📌 Future Improvements
Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Deploy the model via an API

Use advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning
